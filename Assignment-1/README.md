## ML Application 🤖 - Sarcasm Detection in News Headlines 📰

## 🤔 Introduction

Sarcasm detection in text is tricky! 😉 Unlike regular sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral), sarcasm uses irony, making interpretation hard. This project uses **Deep Learning** to detect sarcasm in news headlines from *TheOnion* (sarcastic) & *HuffPost* (non-sarcastic).

**Goal:** Build & evaluate a model to classify headlines, understand its real-world use, and explore future improvements. Knowing sarcasm helps analyze social media, customer feedback, etc., more accurately. 👍

## 💾 Dataset: "News Headline Dataset for Sarcasm Detection"

*   **Source:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection) 💻
*   **Content:** Headlines from *TheOnion* (sarcastic) & *HuffPost* (non-sarcastic).
*   **Structure:**
    *   `is_sarcastic`: Binary label (1 = sarcastic, 0 = not).
    *   `headline`: The actual news headline text. 📝
    *   `article_link`: URL to the original article (optional context). 🔗
*   **Why this dataset?** Professionally written (fewer errors), high-quality sarcastic examples from TheOnion, self-contained headlines. ✅

*Used `Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2.json` for this project.*

## 🛠️ Training Process: Deep Learning Approach

1.  **Load Data:** Read headlines from the JSON file. 📥
2.  **Preprocess Text:**
    *   **Tokenize:** Convert words into numerical sequences (using Keras Tokenizer).
    *   **Pad Sequences:** Ensure all sequences have the same length for model input. 📏
3.  **Build Model Architecture:** 🧠
    *   **Embedding Layer:** Learns word meanings/relationships.
    *   **Global Average Pooling 1D:** Reduces sequence data to a fixed vector.
    *   **Dense Layers:** Learns complex patterns from features.
    *   **Output Layer:** Sigmoid activation for binary (sarcastic/not) probability output. 🎯
4.  **Optimize & Regularize:** To prevent overfitting:
    *   **Early Stopping:** Stops training when performance on validation data stops improving. 🛑
    *   **L2 Regularization:** Penalizes large weights.
    *   **Dropout:** Randomly ignores some neurons during training. ✨

*The best results came from using **Early Stopping** and **Dropout**.*

## 🎉 Results & Key Findings

*   **Performance:** Achieved **~90% accuracy** on the test set! 🏆
*   **Insights:**
    *   Embedding layers successfully captured semantic nuances. ✨
    *   Regularization (Dropout, Early Stopping) significantly improved generalization. 💪
    *   Model is effective but struggles with highly ambiguous or context-dependent sarcasm. 🤔

### 📊 Example Predictions

*   `Have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it.` --> **Sarcastic (72.73%)** 😂
*   `I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me` --> **Sarcastic (15.88%)** 🚶‍♀️💨 *(Note: Lower confidence shows nuance)*
*   `I am so clever that sometimes I do not understand a single word of what I am saying.` --> **Not Sarcastic (0.23%)** 🤔 *(Example of correct classification)*

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

Detecting sarcasm improves:

*   👀 **Social Media Monitoring:** Understand true user sentiment.
*   🗣️ **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Filter genuine vs. ironic comments.
*   📰 **News Aggregation:** Identify or filter satirical sources.
*   🤖 **Chatbots/Virtual Assistants:** Respond more appropriately.
*   🎬 **Content Recommendation:** Suggest relevant satirical/non-satirical content.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1.  **More Context:** Use full articles, not just headlines. 📖
2.  **Multimodal Data:** Include images/video tone if available. 🖼️🔊
3.  **Transfer Learning:** Use pre-trained models like BERT/GPT. 🤖
4.  **Explainability (XAI):** Understand *why* the model makes a decision. 💡
5.  **Cross-Domain Testing:** Check performance on tweets, reviews, etc. 🔄

## ✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated using deep learning to detect sarcasm in news headlines with ~90% accuracy. It highlights the importance of understanding nuanced language in text analysis. While effective, future work incorporating more context, advanced models, and explainability can further improve robustness. 🎉

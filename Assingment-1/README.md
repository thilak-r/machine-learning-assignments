## SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS ON NEWS HEADLINES DATASET FOR SARCASM DETECTION

## Introduction

Sarcasm detection in text is a challenging task within natural language processing (NLP), as it requires understanding context, tone, and intent, which can be ambiguous or implicit. Traditionally, sentimental analysis focuses on determining the emotional tone—positive, negative, or neutral—of a statement. However, sarcasm can complicate this, as a statement might express a positive sentiment but be intended negatively, or vice versa, due to its ironic nature. This report explores the application of sentimental analysis techniques to detect sarcasm using the "News Headline Dataset for Sarcasm Detection," a dataset comprising headlines from TheOnion (sarcastic) and HuffPost (non-sarcastic). Our goal is to build and evaluate a machine learning model for this binary classification task, discussing its implications, real-world applications, and future enhancements.

The importance of sarcasm detection lies in its potential to improve the accuracy of sentimental analysis and other text-based applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and news aggregation. By identifying sarcastic content, we can better understand user intent, especially in scenarios where tone is critical for accurate interpretation.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study is the "News Headline Dataset for Sarcasm Detection," available at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection). It was collected to overcome limitations of noisy Twitter datasets, which often rely on hashtag-based supervision and include contextual replies, making sarcasm detection challenging. This dataset, instead, includes:

*   **Sources**: Sarcastic headlines from TheOnion, known for satirical news, and non-sarcastic headlines from HuffPost, a reputable news source.
*   **Structure**: Each record contains three attributes:
    *   `is_sarcastic`: A binary label (1 for sarcastic, 0 for non-sarcastic).
    *   `headline`: The text of the news headline.
    *   `article_link`: A URL to the original news article, useful for supplementary data collection.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   News headlines are written professionally, reducing spelling mistakes and informal language, which decreases data sparsity and increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings.
    *   TheOnion's focus on sarcastic content ensures high-quality labels with minimal noise compared to Twitter datasets.
    *   Headlines are self-contained, aiding in isolating sarcastic elements without needing additional context.

For this project, we utilized the "Sarcasm\_Headlines\_Dataset\_v2.json" file, processed and split into training and testing sets as detailed in the provided Jupyter Notebook. General statistics, Python reading instructions, and basic exploratory analysis can be found at the GitHub repository, while a hybrid neural network architecture trained on this dataset is also documented there.

## Training Process

To train our model, we adopted a deep learning approach, leveraging a neural network architecture suitable for text classification tasks. The process involved several steps:

### Preprocessing Steps

1.  **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded from a JSON file, ensuring all records were accessible for processing.
2.  **Text Preprocessing**:
    *   Headlines were tokenized using Keras's `Tokenizer`, converting text into sequences of integers based on word frequency.
    *   These sequences were padded to a uniform length using `pad_sequences` to ensure consistency in input size for the neural network, facilitating batch processing.

### Model Architecture

The model architecture consisted of the following layers:

*   **Embedding Layer**: Converted the sequence of word indices into dense vectors, learning a representation for each word that captures semantic relationships.
*   **Global Average Pooling 1D**: Aggregated the sequence output from the embedding layer into a fixed-size vector, reducing dimensionality and computational complexity.
*   **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers processed the pooled features to learn complex patterns, with multiple layers allowing for hierarchical feature extraction.
*   **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a `sigmoid` activation function output a probability score for the sarcastic class, suitable for binary classification.

### Model Variants and Regularization

To optimize the model and prevent overfitting, we experimented with several variants:

*   **Basic Model**: A straightforward model without regularization, serving as a baseline.
*   **Early Stopping**: Monitored validation loss and stopped training when no improvement was observed, preventing overfitting by halting at the optimal epoch.
*   **L2 Regularization**: Added a penalty term to the loss function to constrain model weights, discouraging large weights and promoting generalization.
*   **Dropout**: Randomly dropped a fraction of input units during training to reduce overfitting, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Each variant was trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set to compare performance, with the best configuration selected for final testing.

## Results

The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics on the test set, providing insight into its ability to generalize to unseen data. From the analysis in the provided Jupyter Notebook, the model with **early stopping and dropout achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of approximately 90%** on the test set. This high accuracy indicates the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines.

### Additional Evaluations Included:

*   Testing on new, unseen sentences to demonstrate generalization capability, with examples such as "pool cues go unused in disappointing bar fight" correctly identified as sarcastic.
*   Visualization of word embeddings using t-SNE, reducing dimensionality to plot words in a 2D space, revealing semantic relationships learned by the model and aiding in understanding its internal representations.

### Key findings include:

*   The embedding layer effectively captured semantic relationships, crucial for detecting nuanced sarcasm.
*   Regularization techniques like dropout and early stopping were crucial for improving model generalization, reducing overfitting on the training data.
*   The model accurately classified most headlines, though some edge cases, such as highly ambiguous or context-dependent sarcasm, were misclassified, highlighting areas for improvement.


### Example Evaluation Results:

*   `I am so clever that sometimes I do not understand a single word of what I am saying.`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 0.23%)`
*   `Have no fear of perfection, you'll never reach it.`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 72.73%)`
*   `If you're going to tell people the truth, be funny or they'll kill you.`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 21.23%)`
*   `I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 15.88%)`
*   `Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 0.04%)`
*   `One of the hardest things to imagine is that you are not smarter than average.`
    `(probability of sarcasm --> 1.49%)`
